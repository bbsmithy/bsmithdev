                | In this guide we're going to:
            p     1) Build an image compression script using Python and the PIL library,
            p     2) Then we'll zip our script and PIL library using a Docker Linux container
            p     3) Next we'll go to the lamda console and set up our S3 source bucket trigger and target bucket that the Lamda compression function will use. 
            p     4) We will then upload our compression script zip file to that Lamda.
